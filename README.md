# Zomato-Restaurant-Ratings-Price-Prediction

A data analytics project that looks at Zomato restaurant data to find trends in cuisines, prices, and customer reviews. This project shows how to use Python for end-to-end data cleaning, exploration, and predictive modeling.

 # Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess Zomato's real-world restaurant data.
Recognize pricing and rating patterns according to cuisine, location, and other variables.
To assist in making business decisions, visualize important insights.
Use regression models to forecast restaurant ratings or prices.
